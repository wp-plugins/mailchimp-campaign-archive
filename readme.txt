Adds a [mailchimp_campaigns] shortcode that lists your latest MailChimp email campaigns

== Description ==

**MailChimp Campaign Archive** adds a `[mailchimp_campaigns]` shortcode to WordPress. This shortcode lists your latest MailChimp email campaigns as an unordered list with links to view the HTML version of each email.

= Usage =
The only required parameter is `apikey` which you must generate from MailChimp: https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/

Example usage: `[mailchimp_campaigns apikey="xxxxxxxxxx" limit="10" order="ASC" link_text="title"]`

**apikey**
Generated from https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/

**limit**
Specify how many campaigns to list. Can be any integer between 1 and 1000.

**offset**
If offset is non-negative, the archive list will start at that offset in the list. If offset is negative, the archive list will start that far from the end of the list. For example, set this to 10 to omit the first ten email campaigns from the list, or set it to -2 to omit every campaign that comes before the second to last campaign.

**order**
Can be either ASC or DESC (ascending or descending)

**link_text**
Specify where to get link text. Can be either "subject" or "title"

**status**
Only show campaigns of a specific status. Can be: "sent", "save", "paused", "schedule", or "sending"

**from_name**
Only show campaigns that have this "From Name"

**from_email**
Only show campaigns that have this "Reply-to Email"

**list_id**
Only show campaigns sent to this [list ID.](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/how-can-i-find-my-list-id) The ID for a given list can be found by navigating to the *Lists* page, clicking the Gear drop down, and selecting *List Settings and Unique ID.*

**folder_id**
Only show campaigns from this folder ID. The folder ID can be found in the "`fid`" parameter in the "Folder Archive Code"

**organize_by**
Organize campaign list by date. Can be either "year" or "month"

**heading_tag**
HTML element to use for month/year titles. Only needed if "organize_by" is set. Should be one of: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
